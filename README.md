### linear regresion
Attempted to use linear regression per the module, was ultimately unsuccessful. However the initial prediction was only .49 accuracy. knowing this i would opt for another model. 

Ultimately, i modified the code to reflect the neural network solution. The neuron layers and hidden layers were changed to analyze the difference in outputs.
With two hidden layers, the higher the number of nodes both layer produced better results. running 100 in layer one and 50 in layer 2 resulted in an accuracy of .725
While running only one layer set at 100 the negative result was negligible. and produced accuracy of .72
Accuracy of the model was effected by the number of hiden nodes in each layer.


### Future models
Given the time to coninue to analyze different models, additional learning network would include SVM to look at accuracy vs the previously mentioned models.
